This project is a data analysis of a retail company to identify trends and hidden insights from it's sales data. And make recommendation to management on how to improve their sales and profit

1. The 5 year dataset is from the retail company which can be obtained here superstore.csv. (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning: The quality of the data was ensured by removing the Postal Code column which had missing values beyond acceptable range; the column was also not needed in this analysis. Also formatted the column heads and other entries to make it easier to work with. New columns were created to help with the analysis. They are day, month, year, discount amount, unit price, and selling price.

3. The dataset was grouped variously by market, profit, sales, product name, quantity, category, city, order id, order priority, and region.
